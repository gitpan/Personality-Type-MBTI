Personality-Type-MBTI

Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)


DESCRIPTION

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality test designed
to assist a person in identifying some significant personal
preferences.

The Indicator is frequently used in the areas of pedagogy, group
dynamics, employee training, leadership training, marriage counseling,
and personal development.

The types the MBTI sorts for, known as dichotomies, are extraversion
/ introversion, sensing / intuition, thinking / feeling and judging
/ perceiving. Each of the sixteen types is referred to by a four-letter
abbreviation, such as ESTJ or INFP, indicating that type's preference
in each dichotomy.

The MBTI includes 93 forced-choice questions, which means there are
only two options. Participants may skip questions if they feel they
are unable to choose. Using psychometric techniques, such as item
response theory, the MBTI will then be scored and will attempt to
identify which dichotomy the participant prefers. After taking the
MBTI, participants are given a readout of their score, which will
include a bar graph and number of how many points they received on
a certain scale.

This module calculates the MBTI scores on each scale and, eventually,
will provide integration with other personality type theories (e.g.
Keirsey, Big5).

    use Personality::Type::MBTI;

    my $mbti = Personality::Type::MBTI->new();

    # sample results from a questionnaire
    my @test = qw/i e i e i n s n s n t f t f t p j p j p/;

    # calculate type
    my $type = $mbti->type( @test );

    print "Your type is '$type'\n";
